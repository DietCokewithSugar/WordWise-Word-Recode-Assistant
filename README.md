WordWise-Word-Recode-Assistant

Developed a personalized vocabulary learning website using ChatGPT and Google Text-to-Speech (TTS). The platform leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 API to generate customized learning materials based on user input by dynamically adjusting the prompts to aid vocabulary retention. Additionally, the system integrates Google's TTS API to create listening exercises from the content generated by GPT.

The backend is built using the Flask framework to ensure scalability and efficient request handling. MySQL is used for secure user data management and progress tracking. The platform is designed with four core functional modules: reading comprehension, listening practice, writing assessment, and vocabulary quizzes. It supports a multi-user system, including roles for students, teachers, administrators, and institutions.

The project aims to validate the feasibility of deploying modern large language models (LLMs) in real-world, niche applications.
